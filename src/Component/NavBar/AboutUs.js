        Community Library officially opened on 31 Jan 2013, with the generous sponsorship of CP1 Pte Ltd and Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple. 
        Since then, the Temple’s annual donations continue to regularly refresh the library’s collection with new books and audio-visual materials, 
        offer a diverse spread of approximately 90 cultural, heritage and literary programmes a year for its visitors, and fund the library’s operating 
        and maintenance costs. With a total floor area of 1,000 square metres, this first themed library on Chinese arts and culture is fully supported 
        by philanthropic funds. It is also the first library in Singapore to experiment with a visitor self-service model run by volunteers. 
        It carries a thematic collection of titles on calligraphy, literature, music, painting, traditions, customs and more. 
        There is also a small selection of materials in commonly spoken Chinese dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese. 
        Visitors can also read local and foreign electronic newspapers on large digital screens in the library.
